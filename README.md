# Regex project

Using regular expression in python to extract ip from log file.

## What is regex?
Regex is a tool that uses search pattern to search and manipulate characters or text.

## Basic regex syntax
The basic regex syntax covered here are the ones needed for the project.

1. r(raw string) :  backslashes ('\') are treated as escape sequence in a normal string. Raw string treats the backslash as part of the string.
2. \d : matches single digit from (0-9).
3. {} : Specifies the exact number of occurrences of the previous character
4. '.' :  matches all character. 
5. '\.' : defines a normal dot and not the regular expression ('.') that matches all character.

## Use Case of the Regex project
DevOps engineers are often responsible for monitoring application logs and system metrics. This project can be used to extract IP addresses from logs to analyze and troubleshoot application issues, identify abnormal traffic, or detect potential security breaches.
